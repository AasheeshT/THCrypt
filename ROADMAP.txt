ROADMAP

-Display current speed besides the progress bar and/or average speed upon completion
-Display remaining time
-Key strength feedback (plain/weak/moderate/secure/unrealistic)
-Add build date, version and author info
-Skip encryption/decryption when key has a size of 0 bytes
-Overwrite key and data buffers upon completion
-Option to open file after it has been decrypted
-Replace some of the stack allocations with heap
-Display just input/output filenames instead of the whole path or make it an option
-Optimize single threaded mode
-Prevent user from choosing the key, lookup tables or the program itself as an input or an output file
-Prevent user from choosing the same file as both input and output file
-Optimize threading
-Message on failure
-Log file
-Parameter to disable progress reporting and/or any text output
-Custom console window title
-Fix PRNG seeding during key generation or disable it completely and prompt the user to enter the key (probably using base64 or base58)
-Filename encryption (probably using base64 or base58)
-Option to disable creation of lookup table files and maybe make it off by default
-Detect if file already exists and prompt user for action
-Continue progress if operation was canceled
-Option to quickly/securely delete the original file and/or key file
-Option to operate on the original file directly (without making a copy)
-Preallocate files
-Config/options file
-Unique lookup tables for every key and ability to cache them
-Option to pack multiple files and/or folders into one file
-Backward compatibility
-Bruteforce recovery tool
-Option to shred files
-Corruption detection (run reversed operation and compare file hashes)
-Benchmarking tool
-Option to obfuscate (encode) file (by encrypting it with key 0)
