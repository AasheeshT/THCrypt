ROADMAP

Critical
-Display current speed besides the progress bar and/or average speed at the end
-Remaining time (ETA)
-Key strength info (plain/weak/moderate/secure/unrealistic)
-Add build date, version and author info
-Skip encryption when key has a size of 0 bytes
-Overwrite key and data buffers on completion
-Option to open file after it has been decrypted
-Replace some of the stack allocations with heap
-Display just input/output filenames instead of the whole path (maybe an option)
-Optimize single threaded mode
-Prevent user from choosing the key, lookup tables or program itself as an input or an output file
-Prevent user from choosing the same file as both input and output file

Important
-Optimize threading
-Message on failure
-Log file
-Parameter to disable progress reporting and/or any text output
-Custom title
-Fix RNG seeding during key generation and/or disable it and prompt  the user to enter the key (probably use base64)
-Filename encryption (probably using base64)
-Option to disable creation of lookup table files (maybe even make it on by default)
-Detect if file already exists and prompt user for action
-Continue progress on canceled operation
-Option to delete original file and/or key file (with both normal and secure deletion)
-Encrypt the original file directly (without making a copy)
-Preallocate files

Optional
-Config/options file
-Unique lookup tables (generated from key) and ability to cache them
-Ability to pack multiple files and/or folders into one file
-Backward compatibility
-Bruteforce (and file recovery tool)
-Option to shred file
-Corruption detection (run reversed operation hash the files and compare hashes)
-Benchmarking tool
-Option to just obfuscate (encode) file
